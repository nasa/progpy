    "The goal of this notebook is to instruct users on how to use and extend the NASA PCoE Python Prognostics Python Package (progpy). \n",
    "\n",
    "First some background. The Prognostics Python Package is a python package for the modeling, simulation, state estimation, and prediction of the evolution of state for components, systems, and systems of systems, with a focus on simulating specific events. When used for prognostics, these events are typically system failures, such as a winding failure on a motor or full discharge of a battery. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few definitions:\n",
    "* __Event__: Something that can be predicted (e.g., system failure, warning threshold). An event has either occurred or not. \n",
    "* __Event State__: Progress towards event occurring. Defined as a number where an event state of 0 indicates the event has occurred and 1 indicates no progress towards the event (i.e., fully healthy operation for a failure event). For gradually occurring events (e.g., discharge) the number will progress from 1 to 0 as the event nears. In prognostics, event state is frequently called \"State of Health\" or \"SOH\"\n",
    "* __Inputs__: Control applied to the system being modeled (e.g., current drawn from a battery)\n",
    "* __Outputs__: Measured sensor values from a system (e.g., voltage and temperature of a battery), outputs can be estimated from system state\n",
    "* __States__: Internal parameters (typically hidden states) used to represent the state of the system- can be the same as inputs/outputs but do not have to be.\n",
    "* __Performance Metrics__: Performance characteristics of a system that are a function of system state, but are not directly measured. For example, a performance metric for a electric motor might be the maximum achievable torque \n",
    "* __State Estimation__: The process of estimating the (possibly hidden) state of a system given sensor information on observable states\n",
    "* __Prediction__: The process of predicting the evolution of a system state with time and the occurrence of events. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `progpy` package has the following structure\n",
    "* `progpy.data_models` - package containing algorithms for data-driven models, and parent class `progpy.data_models.DataModel`\n",
    "* `progpy.datasets` - package containing tools for downloading a few relevant datasets\n",
    "* `progpy.loading` - package containing tools for representing different loading profiles\n",
    "* `progpy.models.*` - implemented models (e.g., pump, valve, battery)\n",
    "* `progpy.state_estimators.*` - State Estimation algorithms\n",
    "* `progpy.predictors.*` - Prediction algorithms\n",
    "* `progpy.uncertain_data.*` - Classes for representing data with uncertainty\n",
    "* `progpy.utils.*` - various utility functions and classes\n",
    "* `progpy.CompositeModel` - model of a system-of-systems, combining multiple interrelated models into a single model\n",
    "* `progpy.EnsembleModel` - model combining multiple models of the same system into a single model\n",
    "* `progpy.MixtureOfExpertsModel` - model combining multiple models of the same system into a single model where the \"best\" model is used at every step\n",
    "* `progpy.LinearModel` - parent class for simple linear models\n",
    "* `progpy.PrognosticsModel` - parent class for all prognostics models - defines interfaces that a model must implement, and tools for simulating said model\n",
