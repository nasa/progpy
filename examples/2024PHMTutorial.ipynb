    "2. Combining multiple models of the same system to be simulated together and aggregated (i.e., [Ensemble Models](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/prog_models/EnsembleModel.html) or [Mixture of Expert Models](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/api_ref/progpy/MixtureOfExperts.html)). This is generally done to improve the accuracy of prediction when you have multiple models that each represent part of the behavior or represent a distribution of different behaviors.\n",
