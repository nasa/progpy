    "\n",
    "One of the most basic of functions for models is simulation. Simulation is the process of predicting the evolution of [system's state](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/glossary.html#term-state) with time. Simulation is the foundation of prediction (see __[08 Prediction](08_Prediction.ipynb)__). Unlike full prediction, simulation does not include uncertainty in the state and other product (e.g., [output](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/glossary.html#term-output)) representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce simulating to a specific time (e.g., 3 seconds) using the `simulate_to` method and simulating until a threshold is met rather than a defined time using `simulate_to_threshold`. We will also explore how to make simulations more concrete with [future loading](https://nasa.github.io/progpy/glossary.html#term-future-load) and other advanced features.\n",
