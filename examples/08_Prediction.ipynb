    "Prediction is the process by which future states are estimated, given the initial state (see __[07 State Estimation](07_State%20Estimation.ipynb)__), a model, and an estimate of the future load. An algorithm used to do this is called a predictor. Prediction is often computationally expensive, especially for sample-based approaches with strict precision requirements (which therefore require large number of samples).\n",
